Here are notes that I took while reading the Ted Talks book:

- Long-term reputation is a goal of good presentation and also why some people fear speaking in public.
- A talk can play a critical role in decisions about the future.
  1. The talk that Elon Musk gave to SpaceX employees on August 2, 2008, encouraged them to focus and look forward instead of looking at failures in the past.
  2. The 15-minute speech of Chris Anderson (Writer of this book) in February 2002 inspired the TED community to continue.
- The idea is the most important part of public speaking and can be a complex theory, a simple How-to, or anything else.
- The idea must be recreated from scratch in the audience's mind, so it should be developed based on basic concepts familiar to them.
- The opportunity to speak publicly can itself be a great motivation to explore a subject.
- Give the audience what they need, and avoid self-promotion.
- Prepare what you want to present to the audience.
- Be careful about your company stories, as they may not interest your audience and might be boring.
- A throughline is a sentence of about 15 words that outlines and connects the key points of a talk.
- Due to the time limit and the depth of the concepts, some must be ignored, and the throughline can help with this.
- We need the audience's permission to share an idea and build it on their minds. Connection is the way to earn that permission.
- Eye contact is the first step to building a connection in any talk. Pick a few people, make eye contact, and give them a slight smile.
- Show vulnerability to build trust, but avoid oversharing or sharing something that you don't work on and depends on the audience's response.
- Humor is a powerful tool for connection, but avoid being funny if you are not, and avoid jokes based on gender, race, disability, etc.
- Self-deprecation, rather than self-promotion, can help make trust and connection.
- Stories are an effective tool for connection, especially when combined with self-deprecation, humor, etc.
- An explanation is most effective when it follows a step-by-step approach, sparks curiosity, and includes enough examples and metaphors at each step to ensure the audienceâ€™s understanding.
- The first challenge in giving a talk is finding the step to begin the explanation and the second one is organizing concepts in a linear sequence even though they are like a tree. Knowing the audience's perspective and practicing a mock talk with friends could help to identify the starting point, structure the steps, and fill the gaps between steps for better explanation.
- Avoid over-explaining concepts the audience already knows. For example, there is no need to explain what DNA is in detail in DNA-unrelated talks.
- Persuasion is replacing the audience's worldview with something better. The core of persuasion is Reason (in any form), and we can use intuition pumps, detective stories, visuals, or other plausibility-priming devices to achieve this.
- A talk can be like a wonder walk, guided by a sequence of images and videos, with background explanations and possibly long moments of silence.
- The first step in showing a demo is to provide the necessary background, then show the demo, and finally explain the details. The demo should not be delayed too long. It is also the most memorable part of the talk.

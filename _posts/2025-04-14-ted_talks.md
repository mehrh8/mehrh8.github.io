Here are the notes that I took while reading the Ted Talks book:

- Long-term reputation is a goal of good presentation and also why some people fear speaking in public.
- A talk can play a critical role in decisions about the future.
  1. The talk that Elon Musk gave to SpaceX employees on August 2, 2008, encouraged them to focus and look forward instead of looking at failures in the past.
  2. The 15-minute speech of Chris Anderson (Writer of this book) in February 2002 inspired the TED community to continue.
- The idea is the most important part of public speaking and can be a complex theory, a simple How-to, or anything else.
- The idea must be recreated from scratch in the audience's mind, so it should be developed based on basic concepts familiar to them.
- The opportunity to speak publicly can itself be a great motivation to explore a subject.
- Give the audience what they need, and avoid self-promotion.
- Prepare what you want to present to the audience.
- Be careful about your company stories, as they may not interest your audience and might be boring.
- A throughline is a sentence of about 15 words that outlines and connects the key points of a talk.
- Due to the time limit and the depth of the concepts, some must be ignored, and the throughline can help with this.
- We need the audience's permission to share an idea and build it on their minds. Connection is the way to earn that permission.
- Eye contact is the first step to building a connection in any talk. Pick a few people, make eye contact, and give them a slight smile.
- Show vulnerability to build trust, but avoid oversharing or sharing something that you don't work on and depends on the audience's response.
- Humor is a powerful tool for connection, but avoid being funny if you are not, and avoid jokes based on gender, race, disability, etc.
- Self-deprecation, rather than self-promotion, can help make trust and connection.
- Stories are an effective tool for connection, especially when combined with self-deprecation, humor, etc.
- An explanation is most effective when it follows a step-by-step approach, sparks curiosity, and includes enough examples and metaphors at each step to ensure the audience’s understanding.
- The first challenge in giving a talk is finding the step to begin the explanation and the second one is organizing concepts in a linear sequence even though they are like a tree. Knowing the audience's perspective and practicing a mock talk with friends could help to identify the starting point, structure the steps, and fill the gaps between steps for better explanation.
- Avoid over-explaining concepts the audience already knows. For example, there is no need to explain what DNA is in detail in DNA-unrelated talks.
- Persuasion is replacing the audience's worldview with something better. The core of persuasion is Reason (in any form), and we can use intuition pumps, detective stories, visuals, or other plausibility-priming devices to achieve this.
- A talk can be like a wonder walk, guided by a sequence of images and videos, with background explanations and possibly long moments of silence.
- The first step in showing a demo is to provide the necessary background, then show the demo, and finally explain the details. The demo should not be delayed too long. It is also the most memorable part of the talk.
- Slides (recommended):
  - One idea per slide.
  - Use only one image per slide (avoid multiple images on a single slide).
  - Use a black background for images.
  - Use a blank screen when discussing other topics to avoid distraction.
  - If you are an artist, designer, or similar, showcase your work as much as possible, even if it is just for 5 seconds per piece without explanation.
  - Be mindful of the projector's aspect ratio (16:9 or 4:3)
  - Use fonts larger than 24pt and choose medium-weigh sans-serif fonts, such as Helvetica or Arial.
  - Avoid bullets, dashes, underlining, and italics, but bold text is fine.
  - Place image credits at the top-right corner rotated 90 degrees with a small font size.
  - Use high-quality videos with clear sound when your idea can not be explained through images, but limit to four 30-second videos.
  - Capture video footage of everything in your work, even if you are unsure when you will use it.
  - Avoid transitions; if you must use one, stick to cuts or dissolves.
- Here are three strategies for delivering a scripted talk: memorizing the script, referencing the script during the presentation, and using only bullet points as a guide. The memorization approach requires significant time (around seven hours for an 18-minute talk). If you lack that time, using bullet points may be a more effective option.
- If you can give your talk while multitasking or speaking at double speed, you are probably ready to focus on meaning during the talk.
- The script should be in spoken language, not written language. You can transcribe your first attempt as a starting point and then refine it. Written language may sometimes be acceptable for authors and writers.
- Unscripted talk is not unprepared talk. Practicing different versions of each step and refining transitions helps you achieve mental clarity and a natural flow. Rehearse multiple times, track your timing, and keep your content within 90% of the time limit for better time management.
- Some speakers use a combination of scripted and unscripted approaches. For example, in the preparation stage, they write the script, but during the presentation, they don't follow it strictly.
- Rehearsing and repetition bring scripted and unscripted talks closer together. We should practice whenever possible, sometimes with real people, to gather feedback and improve our talk.
- Four ways to open a talk:
  - Deliver a dose of drama.
  - Ignite curiosity.
  - Show a compelling slide, video, or object.
  - Tease, but do not give it away.
- Seven ways to close talk:
  - **Camera pullback:** show a bigger picture of the talk.
  - **Personal commitment:** end with a personal promise or resolution.
  - **Call to action:** For example, say: “Share this idea.”
  - **Value and vision:** Highlight the core message and future possibilities.
  - **Satisfying encapsulation:** Reframe your message in a memorable summary.
  - **Narrative symmetry:** Echo the beginning of your talk for a full-circle effect.
  - **Lyrical inspiration:** Close with poetic or emotional language, but first prepare the audience for the shift in tone.
- The closing is the most memorable part of the talk and should followed by a simple thank you.
- Tips about Nerves:
  - Use fear as motivation: Practice more.
  - Control adrenaline through breathing or burning it off (e.g., push-ups before the talk)
  - Eat healthy food, keep a protein bar handy, and avoid an empty stomach on the day of your talk.
  - Be Vulnerable: It is OK to say you are nervous (e.g., "Ooops, sorry, just a few nerves here!")
  - Find friends or choose a few people in the audience and focus on them while speaking.
  - Have backup plans for when things go wrong or do not go as expected. (example: Well, now we have more time to talk about something else...)
  - Stay focused on what you are talking about.
- Hand-held note cards (one per slide) are the best approach for many situations.
- The confidence monitor can present some issues (e.g., causing confusion, reducing connection with the audience, or creating over-dependence). However, if you choose to use it, it is best to display the same slides the audience sees. If needed, include only two or three bullet points per slide for guidance.
- Practice using your voice effectively for each part of your talk (e.g., key points, lighter sections, questions, “aha” moments, humorous moments, etc.). Adjust your tone, pace, and volume based on the meaning of what you are saying to keep your audience engaged.
